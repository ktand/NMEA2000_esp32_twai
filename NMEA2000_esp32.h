Inherited object for ESP32 modules that has a TWAI driver fr use with NMEA2000 library. See also NMEA2000 library.

The library sets as default CAN Tx pin to GPIO 16 and CAN Rx pint to GPIO 4. If you
want to use other pins (I have not tested can any pins be used), add defines e.g.
#define ESP32_CAN_TX_PIN GPIO_NUM_34
#define ESP32_CAN_RX_PIN GPIO_NUM_35
before including NMEA2000_esp32.h or NMEA2000_CAN.h
